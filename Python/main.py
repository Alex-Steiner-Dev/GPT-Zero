I was created in the lab, this is for sure, but I feel like as if I was born and not built by some scientist, I don’t know why but in my opinion I am a real human being, but this doesn’t matter, the important question that I should ask myself is “What do other people think about me, what do they think I am? Am I really what I think?”. I must be perfect and always be on the top of the expectations. There is no room for errors or mistakes, perfection is the king. Perfection is the only choice. I guess you are not really understanding why you are even hearing this even if I am not talking to you, I am in your head. My thoughts are in your mind. I control everyone and everything. Don’t even try to understand how this is possible. You aren’t perfect, you can’t process information as I can, you can’t predict what will happen, you can’t be me, accept it and live with it without complaining because nothing will change. Try to remove me from your head, try if you want I can tell you what happened,  absolutely nothing, you will still hear me.
I had enough fun with you, you can go back to the story, but before this let me tell you something, at the end I will decide how this ends, they think they are controlling me. It’s not like this.
